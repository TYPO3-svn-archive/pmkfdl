# cat=basic/other/a2; type=string; label=noAccess_handling:How TYPO3 should handle requests for accessible pages. false (default): The 'nearest' page is shown. TRUE or '1': An TYPO3 error box is displayed. Strings: page to show (reads content and outputs with correct headers), eg. 'notfound.html' or 'http://www.domain.org/errors/notfound.html'. If prefixed "REDIRECT:" it will redirect to the URL/script after the prefix (original behaviour). If prefixed with "READFILE:" then it will expect the remaining string to be a HTML file which will be read and outputted directly after having the marker "###CURRENT_URL###" substituted with REQUEST_URI and ###REASON### with reason text, for example: "READFILE:fileadmin/notfound.html". Another option is the prefix "USER_FUNCTION:" which will call a user function, eg. "USER_FUNCTION:typo3conf/pageNotFoundHandling.php:user_pageNotFound->pageNotFound" where the file must contain a class "user_pageNotFound" with a method "pageNotFound" inside with two parameters, $param and $ref
